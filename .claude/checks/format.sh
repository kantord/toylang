# and could have answered another -- where to cut a long file, and why. Formatting
# has exactly one right answer, so there is nothing to decide, nothing to grill
# anyone about, and nothing worth writing down. A check that would only ever
# teach "run rustfmt" should just run rustfmt.

# So this hook fixes rather than reports, and says nothing when it succeeds.
